# Block User Feature Implementation

## Overview
The "Block User" feature has been fully implemented across the DuckBuck app. Users can now block friends through a consistent workflow, with appropriate confirmation dialogs that are platform-specific (Material for Android and Cupertino for iOS).

## Implementation Details

### 1. UI Component Changes
The block user option is now available in the following places:

**Material UI (Android):**
- Added as a menu item with a block icon in the three dots menu on each friend tile
- Includes a confirmation dialog when selected
- Shows a success snackbar upon completion

**Cupertino UI (iOS):**
- Added as an action in the action sheet that appears when tapping the ellipsis button
- Includes a confirmation alert when selected
- Shows a success alert upon completion

### 2. Provider Implementation
The `FriendsProvider` now includes:
- `blockUser(String relationshipId)` method to handle the blocking logic
- `unblockUser(String relationshipId)` method for future unblocking functionality
- Tracking of processing state with `_processingBlockUserIds` set
- `isBlockingUser(String id)` getter to check if a block operation is in progress

### 3. Usage Example
To implement block functionality in a parent component that contains the FriendsSection:

```dart
// 1. Pass the block dialog handler when using FriendsSection
FriendsSection(
  provider: friendsProvider,
  showRemoveFriendDialog: _showRemoveFriendDialog,
  showBlockUserDialog: _showBlockUserDialog, // Add this line
)

// 2. Implement the handler method
void _showBlockUserDialog(BuildContext context, RelationshipModel relationship) {
  FriendsSection.showBlockFriendDialog(context, relationship, friendsProvider);
}
```

## Testing Instructions

To test the block user functionality:
1. Navigate to the Friends screen
2. For a specific friend, tap the three dots menu (Android) or ellipsis button (iOS)
3. Select "Block User" option
4. Confirm the action in the dialog
5. Verify the success notification appears
6. Check that the user no longer appears in your friends list

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
1. A "Blocked Users" section in Settings to view and manage blocked users
2. Ability to unblock users from this section
3. Analytics tracking for block/unblock actions
