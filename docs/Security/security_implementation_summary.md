# DuckBuck Security Implementation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the security implementation for the DuckBuck app. The implementation includes both Flutter-side and native Android security features.

## Components

### 1. Firebase App Check
- Using Google Play Integrity API on Android
- Implemented through Flutter's Firebase App Check package
- Provides app verification to prevent unauthorized API access

### 2. Android Security Components
- `SecurityManager`: Handles core security operations and method channel communication
- `TamperDetector`: Verifies app signature to detect tampering
- `SSLPinningManager`: Implements certificate pinning for secure API communication

### 3. Flutter Security Services
- `AppSecurityService`: Communicates with native security implementation via method channel
- `SecureScreenMixin`: Adds security features to sensitive screens
- Provides secure data encryption/decryption

## Features

### App Integrity
- App signature verification
- Runtime code integrity checks
- Development vs production security modes

### Data Protection
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- Secure preferences storage
- Screenshot protection for sensitive screens

### Network Security
- SSL certificate pinning
- Network security configuration
- Cleartext traffic prevention

## Security Best Practices
1. Different configurations for debug and release builds
2. No hardcoded sensitive information
3. Screenshot protection for sensitive screens
4. Encrypted secure storage for sensitive data
5. Certificate pinning for network requests
6. Secure storage for encryption keys

## Notes for Developers
- For debug builds, integrity checks are logged but not enforced
- Certificate hashing is implemented for both debug and release
- Secure preferences are used for storing sensitive information
- Screen protection is automatically handled by SecureScreenMixin
