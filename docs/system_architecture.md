# DuckBuck System Architecture

## Overview

DuckBuck is built with a clean architecture that emphasizes separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability. This document outlines the high-level architecture and explains how the authentication, friend, and messaging systems work together.

## Core Architecture

### Layered Design

DuckBuck follows a layered architecture:

1. **UI Layer**: Flutter widgets, screens, and state management
2. **Feature Layer**: Controllers and business logic for specific features
3. **Repository Layer**: Coordination layer for domain operations
4. **Service Layer**: Core services handling specific domains
5. **Model Layer**: Data models representing system entities

### Dependency Injection

DuckBuck uses the `get_it` service locator pattern for dependency injection, making components:
- Easily testable with mock implementations
- Loosely coupled
- Centrally configured

## System Integration

### Authentication - Friend - Messaging Connection

```
┌───────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────┐
│  Authentication   │────>│   Friend System  │────>│   Messaging System  │
│  (Identity)       │     │  (Relationships) │     │  (Communication)    │
└───────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └────────────────────┘
```

1. **Authentication** provides user identity used by both friend and messaging systems
2. **Friend System** determines who can exchange messages
3. **Messaging System** depends on friend status for enabling communication

### Interaction Points

#### Authentication → Friend System
- User IDs from authentication are used to create friend relationships
- User profiles from authentication provide friend details
- Authentication state determines friend system availability

#### Friend System → Messaging System
- Friend status dictates message permission (can only message friends)
- Blocking status prevents message delivery
- Friend lists provide messaging candidate users

## Design Principles

### Separation of Concerns

Each system has clear boundaries:
- **Authentication**: Handles user identity and credentials
- **Friend System**: Manages social connections
- **Messaging System**: Enables communication

### Extension over Modification

The systems are integrated through:
- Extension methods (e.g., `FriendRepositoryMessagingExtension`)
- Controllers that coordinate across systems
- Service locator providing access to needed dependencies

### Loose Coupling

Systems interact through well-defined interfaces:
- Repository abstractions hide implementation details
- Controllers coordinate between systems without tight coupling
- Services focus on single responsibilities

## Data Flow

### Example: Sending a Message

1. **Authentication** confirms user identity
2. **Friend System** verifies friendship status
3. **Messaging System** delivers the message

```
User Action → MessageFeatureController → FriendRepository.canSendMessage()
            → MessageRepository.sendMessage() → Firebase → Recipient Device
```

## Error Handling

The architecture includes comprehensive error handling:
- Service layer captures technical errors
- Repository layer translates to domain-specific exceptions
- Controller layer presents user-friendly error messages
- Error states are propagated through proper channels

## Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed for future extensions:
1. **Group Messaging**: Can be added without modifying existing systems
2. **Rich Media**: Media types can be extended without changing core messaging
3. **Additional Auth Methods**: New authentication methods can be integrated easily

## Testing Strategy

The clean architecture supports a robust testing strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: For service and repository logic
- **Integration Tests**: For feature controllers
- **Widget Tests**: For UI components
- **Mock Services**: For isolating components during testing

## Conclusion

DuckBuck's architecture provides a solid foundation for the application with clear separation between authentication, friend management, and messaging systems. This design ensures maintainability, extensibility, and reliability as the application evolves.
