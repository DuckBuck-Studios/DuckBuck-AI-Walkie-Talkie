# DuckBuck Security Implementation

## Overview

Security is a fundamental aspect of the DuckBuck app, integrated throughout the authentication, friend, and messaging systems. This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect user data, ensure proper access controls, and maintain user privacy.

## Authentication Security

### Credential Security
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are never stored in plaintext, using Firebase Auth's secure hashing
- **Token Management**: JWT tokens with short expiration times and secure refresh mechanisms
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Preparation for future MFA implementation
- **Session Management**: Proper handling of auth tokens with secure storage

### Account Security
- **Email Verification**: Required for sensitive operations
- **Phone Verification**: OTP-based verification for phone authentication
- **Account Recovery**: Secure password reset mechanisms
- **Login Anomaly Detection**: Monitoring for suspicious login attempts

### Social Authentication
- **OAuth Security**: Proper implementation of OAuth protocols for Google and Apple Sign-In
- **Token Validation**: Server-side validation of social authentication tokens
- **Provider ID Linking**: Secure linking of multiple auth methods to a single account

## Friend System Security

### Relationship Security
- **Mutual Consent**: Friend relationships require explicit consent from both parties
- **Request Validation**: Friend requests are validated for authenticity
- **Relationship Integrity**: Database rules prevent tampering with friend connections

### Blocking Mechanism
- **Comprehensive Blocking**: Block status prevents all interactions between users
- **Block Privacy**: Users are not informed when they are blocked
- **Block Persistence**: Blocks remain effective even through app reinstalls

## Messaging Security

### Message Delivery Security
- **Friend Validation**: Messages can only be sent between confirmed friends
- **Block Enforcement**: Messages cannot be sent to/from blocked users
- **Message Integrity**: Messages cannot be altered after sending

### Media Security
- **Secure Storage**: Media files stored with proper ACLs in Firebase Storage
- **Access Control**: Direct URLs to media require authentication
- **Deletion Control**: Media files properly deleted when messages are removed

### Conversation Security
- **Participant Validation**: Only conversation participants can access messages
- **Unread Counts**: Separate unread counts maintained per participant
- **Delete Controls**: Messages can be deleted by sender for all participants

## Database Security

### Firestore Security Rules
- **User-specific Access**: Users can only access their own data
- **Friend-based Access**: Messages accessible only to conversation participants
- **Write Validation**: Data writes are validated for proper format and authorization

### Storage Security Rules
- **Path-based Security**: Media files accessible only to conversation participants
- **Metadata Protection**: File metadata protected from unauthorized access
- **Upload Validation**: Media uploads validated for file type and size

## Network Security

### API Security
- **HTTPS Encryption**: All communication with Firebase uses TLS
- **Request Authentication**: All API requests require valid Firebase auth tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks

### Device Security
- **Secure Local Storage**: Sensitive data stored using platform-appropriate secure storage
- **App Security**: Appropriate app permissions and secure defaults
- **Timeout Handling**: Proper handling of network timeouts and failures

## Compliance Considerations

### Privacy Controls
- **User Control**: Users can delete their data and conversations
- **Data Minimization**: Only essential data is collected and stored
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation of what data is collected

### Audit Logging
- **Security Events**: Important security events are logged for auditing
- **Access Logging**: Unusual access patterns are flagged for review
- **Error Tracking**: Security-related errors are tracked and monitored

## Future Security Enhancements

1. **End-to-End Encryption**:
   - Implement E2EE for messaging
   - Key management infrastructure
   - Forward secrecy protections

2. **Advanced Authentication**:
   - Multi-factor authentication options
   - Biometric authentication integration
   - Hardware security key support

3. **Threat Detection**:
   - Anomaly detection for messaging patterns
   - Abuse reporting and handling systems
   - Automated security scanning
