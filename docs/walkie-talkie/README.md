## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Background Persistence
- **Foreground Service**: Prevents Android from killing walkie-talkie calls
- **Wake Lock Management**: Keeps device responsive during calls
- **Auto-Restart**: Service automatically restarts if terminated
- **Background Audio**: Full audio functionality when app is backgrounded

### 2. Auto-Connect Technology
- **FCM Triggers**: Incoming calls connect automatically via push notifications
- **Smart Processing**: Intelligent handling based on app state
- **No User Intervention**: Seamless connection without user interaction
- **Cross-Device Support**: Works across different Android devices and versions

### 3. Professional Audio Quality
- **Agora RTC Integration**: Industry-leading real-time communication
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for instant voice transmission
- **Echo Cancellation**: Built-in noise reduction and audio processing
- **Hardware Integration**: Support for all audio hardware configurations

### 4. Smart Notification System
